Kenedy's use of the bully pulpit enables him (the president) to direct pressure from the public (who elect members of Congress) in order to achieve policy goals, as Congress would have to risk losing their seats should they fail to carry out the will of constituents (which has been shaped by the bully pulpit). Consequently, congressional oversight could have expanded funding for NASA and requested congressional hearings at a significant rate so congress is constantly updated about the progress that has been made on the Moon project, and is able to provide any resources NASA still requires (as Congress now has an interest in ensuring that the project is completed).\n",
